04. Given this array: How could you remove the `pineapple`?

    ```js
    let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple', 'orange', 'strawberry']
    ```

    > I personally like to use the splice function with the first arg being the value you want to remove and the second arg being the amount of items to remove, in this case it would look something like fruit.splice('pineapple', 1).

05. Given these two objects: How could you add each to the others friends arrays?

    ```js
    let you = {
        name: "You",
        hair: true,
        friends: []
    }
    let them = {
        name: "Them",
        hair: false,
        friends: []
    }
    ```
