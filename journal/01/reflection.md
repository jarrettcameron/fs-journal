# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
    I feel like a lot went well this week, started a bit slow but it's getting to perfect pace right now.
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
    I think fully understanding the bootstrap flex/grid system was pretty shocking. I've used bootstrap before for a few things here and there and thought I had a decent understanding of it until I learned more about it and realized how useful it really was.
- What are you struggling with?
    There's not too much to struggle with (yet). I think bootstrap has a lot of components and utilies that I've yet to learn so that's probably the one struggle I do have.
- What would you count as a victory?
    Pretty much all of the afternoon labs have been really nice, it's pretty satisfying to apply topics we learned in lecture and get to mess with them and understand them further.
