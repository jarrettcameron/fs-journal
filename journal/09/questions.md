01. What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is an idea in Object-Oriented Programming that allows classes to inherit behavior, methods and structure from another class. A prime example of a time we use this in class would be working with the express template we create controllers by extending from a util 'BaseController'. This allows the newly created controller to inheit behavior from that util class (registering the controller with express).

02. What is the `Singleton` design pattern?

> The singleton design pattern is a pattern that restricts a class to only have one instance of itself. This is done to keep things more organized and to prevent possible conflicts of multiple instances accessing the same resources at once. A time that we've used something similar would be with MVC services, when we create a service class we don't export the class but instead export an instance of the class. This effectively limits the instances of the class to one instance.

03. What is the `Observer` design pattern?

> The observer design pattern is used to efficiently communicate between objects. This is done through events, one object subscribes to be notified of an event through the other, this object will then notify it when changes are made. We used a similar structure with the mvc starter with AppState.on().

04. What is the `Strategy` design pattern?

> Strategy design pattern is used when a class all have a basic structure and function to them but need to be altered slightly across multiple algorithms. Strategy pattern allows an algorithm to be applied to the basic class instance.
